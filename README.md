# Travel Landing Page Components

React components made from Traversy Media YouTube course [Create a Website With Video Background | HTML & CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MgpE2DTTKA)

## Usage

The menu toggle functionality is actually located in the video section since that is what moves to show the menu, but it could be rewritten to move the menu over the section instead.

index.css is for global styling

HTML and CSS credit goes to Brad Traversy from the above linked course :)

Just put together for a bit of fun
